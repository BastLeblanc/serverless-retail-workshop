            "description": "The center of gravity in this Spinning Reel means the oscillation gear is now closer to the rod, making the feel more balanced. Propulsion Line Management system produces longer casts and less backlash. Instant anti-reverse for zero backplay. Spool has an angled spool lip that allows the line to leave the spool with less friction for more casting distance. Compact body is light, rigid and suited for anything from freshwater to inshore fishing. Lays the line evenly across the spool. Reduces wobble during the retrieve.",
